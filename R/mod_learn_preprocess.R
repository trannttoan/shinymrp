The survey/test data contains the geographic-demographic information about participants and their survey responses or test results. Inferring the relationship between them using regression models constitutes the first stage of MRP. Additionally, geographic covariates are included in these models to account for the structured difference among geographic areas such as states and counties. The second stage of MRP is poststratification, which involves adjusting the estimates based on the breakdown of the target population.
